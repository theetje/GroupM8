## Types

Always use Swift's native types when available. Swift offers bridging to Objective-C so you can still use the full set of methods as needed.

**Preferred:**
```swift
let width = 120.0                                    // Double
let widthString = (width as NSNumber).stringValue    // String
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
let width: NSNumber = 120.0                          // NSNumber
let widthString: NSString = width.stringValue        // NSString
```

In Sprite Kit code, use `CGFloat` if it makes the code more succinct by avoiding too many conversions.

### Constants

Constants are defined using the `let` keyword, and variables with the `var` keyword. Always use `let` instead of `var` if the value of the variable will not change.

**Tip:** A good technique is to define everything using `let` and only change it to `var` if the compiler complains!

You can define constants on a type rather than on an instance of that type using type properties. To declare a type property as a constant simply use `static let`. Type properties declared in this way are generally preferred over global constants because they are easier to distinguish from instance properties. Example:

**Preferred:**
```swift
enum Math {
  static let e = 2.718281828459045235360287
  static let root2 = 1.41421356237309504880168872
}

let hypotenuse = side * Math.root2

```
**Note:** The advantage of using a case-less enumeration is that it can't accidentally be instantiated and works as a pure namespace.

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
let e = 2.718281828459045235360287  // pollutes global namespace
let root2 = 1.41421356237309504880168872

let hypotenuse = side * root2 // what is root2?
```

### Static Methods and Variable Type Properties

Static methods and type properties work similarly to global functions and global variables and should be used sparingly. They are useful when functionality is scoped to a particular type or when Objective-C interoperability is required.

### Optionals

Declare variables and function return types as optional with `?` where a nil value is acceptable.

Use implicitly unwrapped types declared with `!` only for instance variables that you know will be initialized later before use, such as subviews that will be set up in `viewDidLoad`.

When accessing an optional value, use optional chaining if the value is only accessed once or if there are many optionals in the chain:

```swift
self.textContainer?.textLabel?.setNeedsDisplay()
```

Use optional binding when it's more convenient to unwrap once and perform multiple operations:

```swift
if let textContainer = self.textContainer {
  // do many things with textContainer
}
```

When naming optional variables and properties, avoid naming them like `optionalString` or `maybeView` since their optional-ness is already in the type declaration.

For optional binding, shadow the original name when appropriate rather than using names like `unwrappedView` or `actualLabel`.

**Preferred:**
```swift
var subview: UIView?
var volume: Double?

// later on...
if let subview = subview, let volume = volume {
  // do something with unwrapped subview and volume
}
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
var optionalSubview: UIView?
var volume: Double?

if let unwrappedSubview = optionalSubview {
  if let realVolume = volume {
    // do something with unwrappedSubview and realVolume
  }
}
```

### Use of Self

For conciseness, avoid using `self` since Swift does not require it to access an object's properties or invoke its methods.

Use self only when required by the compiler (in `@escaping` closures, or in initializers to disambiguate properties from arguments). In other words, if it compiles without `self` then omit it.


### Computed Properties

For conciseness, if a computed property is read-only, omit the get clause. The get clause is required only when a set clause is provided.

**Preferred:**
```swift
var diameter: Double {
  return radius * 2
}
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
var diameter: Double {
  get {
    return radius * 2
  }
}
```

## Comments

When they are needed, use comments to explain **why** a particular piece of code does something. Comments must be kept up-to-date or deleted.

Avoid block comments inline with code, as the code should be as self-documenting as possible. *Exception: This does not apply to those comments used to generate documentation.*


## Classes and Structures

### Which one to use?

Remember, structs have [value semantics](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH13-XID_144). Use structs for things that do not have an identity. An array that contains [a, b, c] is really the same as another array that contains [a, b, c] and they are completely interchangeable. It doesn't matter whether you use the first array or the second, because they represent the exact same thing. That's why arrays are structs.

Classes have [reference semantics](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH13-XID_145). Use classes for things that do have an identity or a specific life cycle. You would model a person as a class because two person objects are two different things. Just because two people have the same name and birthdate, doesn't mean they are the same person. But the person's birthdate would be a struct because a date of 3 March 1950 is the same as any other date object for 3 March 1950. The date itself doesn't have an identity.

Sometimes, things should be structs but need to conform to `AnyObject` or are historically modeled as classes already (`NSDate`, `NSSet`). Try to follow these guidelines as closely as possible.

### Example definition

Here's an example of a well-styled class definition:

```swift
class Circle: Shape {
  var x: Int, y: Int
  var radius: Double
  var diameter: Double {
    get {
      return radius * 2
    }
    set {
      radius = newValue / 2
    }
  }

  init(x: Int, y: Int, radius: Double) {
    self.x = x
    self.y = y
    self.radius = radius
  }

  convenience init(x: Int, y: Int, diameter: Double) {
    self.init(x: x, y: y, radius: diameter / 2)
  }

  override func area() -> Double {
    return Double.pi * radius * radius
  }
}

extension Circle: CustomStringConvertible {
  var description: String {
    return "center = \(centerString) area = \(area())"
  }
  private var centerString: String {
    return "(\(x),\(y))"
  }
}
```

The example above demonstrates the following style guidelines:

 + Specify types for properties, variables, constants, argument declarations and other statements with a space after the colon but not before, e.g. `x: Int`, and `Circle: Shape`.
 + Define multiple variables and structures on a single line if they share a common purpose / context.
 + Indent getter and setter definitions and property observers.
 + Don't add modifiers such as `internal` when they're already the default. Similarly, don't repeat the access modifier when overriding a method.
 + Organize extra functionality (e.g. printing) in extensions.
 + Hide non-shared, implementation details such as `centerString` inside the extension using `private` access control.

### Unused Code

Unused (dead) code, including Xcode template code and placeholder comments should be removed. An exception is when your tutorial or book instructs the user to use the commented code.

Aspirational methods not directly associated with the tutorial whose implementation simply calls the superclass should also be removed. This includes any empty/unused UIApplicationDelegate methods.

**Preferred:**
```swift
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
  return Database.contacts.count
}
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
  super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
  // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.
}

override func numberOfSections(in tableView: UITableView) -> Int {
  // #warning Incomplete implementation, return the number of sections
  return 1
}

override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
  // #warning Incomplete implementation, return the number of rows
  return Database.contacts.count
}

```
### Minimal Imports

Keep imports minimal. For example, don't import `UIKit` when importing `Foundation` will suffice.

## Spacing

* Indent using 2 spaces rather than tabs to conserve space and help prevent line wrapping. Be sure to set this preference in Xcode and in the Project settings as shown below:


* Method braces and other braces (`if`/`else`/`switch`/`while` etc.) always open on the same line as the statement but close on a new line.
* Tip: You can re-indent by selecting some code (or ⌘A to select all) and then Control-I (or Editor\Structure\Re-Indent in the menu). Some of the Xcode template code will have 4-space tabs hard coded, so this is a good way to fix that.

**Preferred:**
```swift
if user.isHappy {
  // Do something
} else {
  // Do something else
}
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
if user.isHappy
{
  // Do something
}
else {
  // Do something else
}
```

## Code Organization

Use extensions to organize your code into logical blocks of functionality. Each extension should be set off with a `// MARK: -` comment to keep things well-organized.

### Protocol Conformance

In particular, when adding protocol conformance to a model, prefer adding a separate extension for the protocol methods. This keeps the related methods grouped together with the protocol and can simplify instructions to add a protocol to a class with its associated methods.

**Preferred:**
```swift
class MyViewController: UIViewController {
  // class stuff here
}

// MARK: - UITableViewDataSource
extension MyViewController: UITableViewDataSource {
  // table view data source methods
}

// MARK: - UIScrollViewDelegate
extension MyViewController: UIScrollViewDelegate {
  // scroll view delegate methods
}
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
class MyViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDataSource, UIScrollViewDelegate {
  // all methods
}
```


## Smiley Face

Smiley faces are a very prominent style feature of the [raywenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com/) site! It is very important to have the correct smile signifying the immense amount of happiness and excitement for the coding topic. The closing square bracket `]` is used because it represents the largest smile able to be captured using ASCII art. A closing parenthesis `)` creates a half-hearted smile, and thus is not preferred.

**Preferred:**
```
:]
```

**Not Preferred:**
```
:)
```
